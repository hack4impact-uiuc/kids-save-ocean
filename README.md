# Kids Save Ocean

## A sustainability project accelerator ðŸš€

We will create an online platform that helps youth (as a primary target in a wider audience) both understand sustainability issues and build real-life solutions: ones that can be used as best-practice models by others around the world.

The platform will be gamified, incorporating an engine of the world's most powerful solution-building approaches (human-centered design and Silicon Valley business strategies) to empower young people to help protect our planet and its future.
