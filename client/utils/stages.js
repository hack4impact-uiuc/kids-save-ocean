This exercise will help you identify whether your solutions are incremental, evolutionary, or revolutionary and whether your solutions extend, adapt, or create a totally new offering. You’ll also clarify whether your solutions are targeted at your current user group or whether they expand to a new group. By seeing your solutions in relation to each other, you’ll quickly ascertain which ones your organization has the means, manpower, and capacity to undertake.",
